                Yes, of course. Our clients are located all over the US, such as
                NY, Hawaii, Florida, etc. Now that we can do most accounting
                work utilizing the internet, we can provide most accounting
                related service remotely. Even when there is an IRS audit, we
                could have the case transferred to local office and will meet
                the agent here in Orange County.
