                  <p>
                    During the department store underground boom at that time,
                    he worked as a salesman who made a large line at the
                    storefront. Named “Devil for Sale” and “Genius of Sales” by
                    major department store buyers. After that, he became
                    interested in “aggressive corporate management” from
                    “selling”, and in 2004 joined Two Miles as a trainee. Since
                    then, he has provided accounting and tax services mainly for
                    small businesses.

                  <p>
                    In 2012, he moved to Hawaii to realize his slow life with
                    his dog (a twin miniature dachshund). In September of the
                    same year, he established the Two Miles Hawaii office. Use
