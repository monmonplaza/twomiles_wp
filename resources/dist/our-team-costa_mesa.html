                        I came from S. Korea in 2007 and started my career as an
                        tax accountant in Two Miles from 2009. I graduated from
                        Yonsei University's Graduate School of International
                        Studies (Finance-focused)

                        Two Miles are flexible in many respects and allows me to
                        keep a balance between work and family. Also, clients in
                        various industries encourage me to learn what customers
                        really wants on their daily business accounting.
                        Furthermore, the atmosphere in the office is like Google
                        (Although I have never been with it). There is no
                        hierarchy but nice co-workers who collaborate each other
                        in Two Miles.

                        I enjoy having a quality time with my family – visiting
                        near-by parks and watching kids having fun.
